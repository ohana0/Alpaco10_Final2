Cisplatin and carboplatin provide similar mar-ginal improvement in survival beyond that obtained by debulkingand radiation therapy. In keeping with general experience in thisﬁeld, the report of the Glioma Meta-analysis Trialists (GMT)Group concluded there was a clear but small beneﬁt of chemo-therapy. Brachytherapy (implantation of iodine-125 oriridium-193beads or needles) and high-dose focused radiation (stereotactic ra-diosurgery) have so far not signiﬁcantly altered survival times.\\nThe treatment of recurrent tumor after surgery and radiation,\\nan almost inevitable occurrence, is controversial and must beguided by the location and pattern of tumor growth, the patient’sage, and relative state of health. Almost all glioblastomas recurwithin 2 cm of their original site and 10 percent developadditionallesions at distant locations. Reoperation is sometimes undertakenfor local recurrences, as is brachytherapy, both with uncertain re-sults. The most aggressive approach, a second surgery and chemo-therapy, has been generally utilized in patients under age 40 whoseoriginal operation was many months earlier. If the PCV regimendiscussed above has not already been used, that combination orthenewer and better-tolerated alkylating agent temozolomide (whichmay be used if the PCV regimen was administered previously) aresometimes used in cases of recurrent glioblastoma and anaplasticastrocytoma. In general, these chemotherapeutic drugs prolong thesymptom-free interval but have little effect on survival.\\nWith aggressive surgical removal and radiotherapy, as de-\\nscribed above, median survival for patients with glioblastomais 12months, compared to 7 to 9 months without such treatment. Themedian survival in cases of anaplastic astrocytoma is considerablylonger, 2 to 4 years. Viewed from another perspective, in a recentlarge series, the 18-month postoperative survival was 15 percentinpatients with glioblastoma and 62 percent in those with anaplasticastrocytoma.\\nAstrocytoma (Well-Differentiated Astrocytoma) The well-\\ndifferentiated astrocytomas (grades I and II in former classiﬁca-\\ntions), which constitute between 25 and 30 percent of cerebralgliomas, may occur anywhere in the brain or spinal cord. Favoredsites are the cerebrum, cerebellum, hypothalamus, optic nerve andchiasm, and pons. In general, the location of the tumor appears tobeinﬂuencedbytheageofthepatient.Astrocytomasofthecerebralhemispheres arise mainly in adults in their third and fourthdecadesor earlier; astrocytomas in other parts of the nervous system, par-ticularly the posterior fossa and optic nerves, are more frequent inchildren and adolescents. These tumors are classiﬁed further ac-cording to their histologic characteristics: protoplasmic or ﬁbril-lary; gemistocytic (enlarged cells distended with hyaline and eo-sinophilic material); pilocytic (elongated, bipolar cells); andmixedastrocytoma-oligodendroglioma types. The most common type iscomposed of well-differentiated ﬁbrillary astrocytes. The tumorcellscontainglialﬁbrillaryacidicprotein(GFAP),whichisausefuldiagnostic marker in biopsy specimens. Some cerebral astrocyto-mas, as already noted, present as mixed astrocytomas and glio-blastomas.Themostcommonlow-gradeﬁbrillarytypecorrespondstoaWHOgradeIIandisdistinguishedfromthemorebenignWHOgrade I pilocytic tumor (see page 578). The rarer pleomorphicxanthoastrocytoma was also classed as WHO II. Thesedistinctionscorrelate to a large degree with the biologic behavior of the astro-cytomas and therefore have prognostic importance.\\nCerebral astrocytoma is a slowly growing tumor of inﬁltrative\\ncharacter with a tendency in some cases to form large cavities orpseudocysts. Other tumors of this category are noncavitating andappear grayish white, ﬁrm, and relatively avascular, almost indis-tinguishable from normal white matter, with which they mergeim-perceptibly. Fine granules of calcium may be deposited in parts ofthe tumor, but this ﬁnding in a slow-growing intracerebral tumoris more characteristic of an oligodendroglioma. The CSF is acel-lular; the only abnormalities in some cases are the increased pres-sureandproteincontent.Thetumormaydistortthelateralandthirdventricles and displace the anterior and middle cerebral arteries(seen in CTscans,MRarteriograms,andconventionalangiograms;see Fig. 31-3).\\nIn about half of patients with astrocytoma, the opening symp-\\ntomisafocalorgeneralizedseizure,andbetween60and75percentof patients have recurrent seizures in the course of their illness.Other subtle cerebral symptoms follow after months, sometimesafter years. Headaches and signs of increased intracranial pressureare relatively late occurrences.\\nMRI may be helpful in distinguishing the more frequent ﬁ-\\nbrillary from pilocytic astrocytomas. Pilocytic types are sharplydemarcated,withsmoothbordersandlittleedema.OnT1-weightedMRI, they are isointense or hypointense; on T2 sequences, hyper-intense, and there tends to be marked enhancement after gadolin-ium infusion. Cyst formation and small amounts of calcium arecommon, especially in cerebellar tumors. The ﬁbrillary tumorshave a less stereotyped appearance, generally taking the form of ahypodense mass with less well deﬁned borders and little or nocontrast enhancement (Fig. 31-3).\\n555 CHAPTER 31 INTRACRANIALNEOPLASMSAND PARANEOPLASTICDISORDERS45077 Ropper:AdamsandVictor’sPrinciplesofNeurology,8/EMcGraw-Hill BATCH RIGHT\\ntopofrh\\nbaseofrh\\ncapheight\\nbaseoftext\\nshort\\nstand\\nlong\\ndropfolio\\nFigure 31-3.

Astrocytoma of the left frontal lobe; the T2-weighted MRI\\nshows an inﬁltrating tumor with minimal mass effectand slightedema.The\\ndegree of enhancement varies.5 months on average (see below). The addition of the chemother-\\napeutic agent carmustine(BCNU)aloneincreasessurvivalslightly.Although there are no satifsactory randomized trials, it is consid-ered by most neuro-oncologists that somewhat longer survival canbe achieved when a combination of drugs—procarbazine, lomus-tine (CCNU), and vincristine (a combination termed PCV)—is\\ngiven (Levin et al). Cisplatin and carboplatin provide similar mar-ginal improvement in survival beyond that obtained by debulkingand radiation therapy. In keeping with general experience in thisﬁeld, the report of the Glioma Meta-analysis Trialists (GMT)Group concluded there was a clear but small beneﬁt of chemo-therapy. Brachytherapy (implantation of iodine-125 oriridium-193beads or needles) and high-dose focused radiation (stereotactic ra-diosurgery) have so far not signiﬁcantly altered survival times.\\nThe treatment of recurrent tumor after surgery and radiation,\\nan almost inevitable occurrence, is controversial and must beguided by the location and pattern of tumor growth, the patient’sage, and relative state of health. Almost all glioblastomas recurwithin 2 cm of their original site and 10 percent developadditionallesions at distant locations. Reoperation is sometimes undertakenfor local recurrences, as is brachytherapy, both with uncertain re-sults. The most aggressive approach, a second surgery and chemo-therapy, has been generally utilized in patients under age 40 whoseoriginal operation was many months earlier. If the PCV regimendiscussed above has not already been used, that combination orthenewer and better-tolerated alkylating agent temozolomide (whichmay be used if the PCV regimen was administered previously) aresometimes used in cases of recurrent glioblastoma and anaplasticastrocytoma. In general, these chemotherapeutic drugs prolong thesymptom-free interval but have little effect on survival.\\nWith aggressive surgical removal and radiotherapy, as de-\\nscribed above, median survival for patients with glioblastomais 12months, compared to 7 to 9 months without such treatment. Themedian survival in cases of anaplastic astrocytoma is considerablylonger, 2 to 4 years. Viewed from another perspective, in a recentlarge series, the 18-month postoperative survival was 15 percentinpatients with glioblastoma and 62 percent in those with anaplasticastrocytoma.\\nAstrocytoma (Well-Differentiated Astrocytoma) The well-\\ndifferentiated astrocytomas (grades I and II in former classiﬁca-\\ntions), which constitute between 25 and 30 percent of cerebralgliomas, may occur anywhere in the brain or spinal cord.

Here's a breakdown of the key information presented:\\n\\n**Types and Classification:**\\n\\n* **Well-Differentiated Astrocytoma (Grades I and II):**  The most common type, slow-growing, often found in adults, categorized by histological features like fibrillary, gemistocytic, or pilocytic.\\n* **Anaplastic Astrocytoma (WHO Grade III):** More aggressive than well-differentiated astrocytomas, with faster growth and higher malignancy.\\n\\n* **Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) (WHO Grade IV):** The most aggressive type, highly malignant, rapid growth, and often invades surrounding brain tissue.\\n\\n**Location:**  Astrocytomas can occur anywhere in the central nervous system but are commonly found in:\\n* Cerebral hemispheres (adults)\\n* Cerebellum, optic nerves, pons (children and adolescents)\\n\\n**Symptoms:**\\n\\n* **Seizures:** Often the initial symptom in both children and adults. \\n* **Headaches:** May develop as the tumor grows.\\n* **Other subtle neurological symptoms:** Vary depending on the location of the tumor, such as weakness, numbness, vision problems, speech difficulties, personality changes.\\n\\n**Diagnosis:**\\n\\n* **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):** The primary imaging tool for diagnosing and staging astrocytomas. It provides detailed images of brain structure and can detect tumors.\\n* **Biopsy:**  A sample of tumor tissue is taken to confirm the diagnosis and determine the specific type of astrocytoma.\\n\\n**Treatment:**\\n\\n* **Surgery:** To remove as much of the tumor as possible, often combined with other treatments.\\n* **Radiation Therapy:** Uses high-energy beams to kill cancer cells. \\n* **Chemotherapy:** Drugs are used to kill cancer cells that may remain after surgery and radiation therapy. Targeted therapies are also being investigated.\\n\\n\\n**Prognosis:**\\n\\nThe prognosis for astrocytomas depends on several factors, including:\\n\\n* **Grade of the tumor:** Higher-grade tumors (GBM) have a poorer prognosis than lower-grade tumors (Grades I & II).\\n* **Location and size of the tumor:** Tumors in certain locations or that are very large can be more difficult to treat.\\n* **Age and overall health of the patient.**\\n\\n**Research and Ongoing Developments:**\\n\\nScientists continue to research new and improved treatments for astrocytomas, including:\\n\\n* **Immunotherapy:** Harnessing the body's own immune system to fight cancer cells.\\n* **Targeted therapies:** Drugs that specifically target certain molecules involved in tumor growth.\\n\\n\\nThe information presented in this text emphasizes the complexity of astrocytoma diagnosis and treatment. It highlights the importance of multidisciplinary care, involving neurosurgeons, oncologists, neurologists, and other specialists to provide comprehensive patient management.\"}\n",

Man-nitol is the most widely used; a 25% solution is administered par-enterally in a dose of 0.5 to 1.0 g/kg body weight over a period of2 to 10 min.

The pressure from a mass within any onedural compartment causes shifts or herniations of brain tissue to anadjacent compartment where the pressure is lower. The three well-known herniations are: subfalcial ,transtentorial , andcerebellar–\\nforamenmagnum (seeFig. 17-1), andthereareseverallessfamiliar\\nones (upwardcerebellar-tentorial ,diencephalic–sellaturcica ,and\\norbitalfrontal–middlecranial fossa). Herniation of swollen brain\\nthrough an opening in the calvarium, in relation to craniocerebralinjury or operation, is yet another (transcalvarial) type. As men-tioned, the transtentorial herniations relating primarily to comawere discussed in Chap. 17. Here, those that are often seen incasesof brain tumor are emphasized. The writings of Meyer, Jefferson,and Kernohan may be consulted for the early descriptions of theherniations.\\nSubfalcialherniation , in which the cingulate gyrus is pushed\\nunder the falx, occurs frequently, but little is known of its clinicalmanifestations except that there is often occlusion of an anteriorcerebral artery and frontallobeinfarction.The cerebellar–foramen\\nmagnum herniation orpressure cone , described by Cushing in\\n1917, consists of downward displacement of the inferior medialparts of the cerebellar hemispheres (mainly the ventralparaﬂocculior tonsillae) through the foramen magnum, behind the cervicalcord. The displacement may be bilateral or, in the case of a one-sided cerebellar lesion, ipsilateral. Bilateral displacement may re-', 'result': \"This text excerpt discusses various aspects of brain tumors, particularly focusing on the complications arising from increased intracranial pressure (ICP). \\n\\nHere's a breakdown of the key points:\\n\\n**Increased ICP and its Effects:**\\n\\n* The pressure exerted by a growing tumor within the skull can cause shifts and herniations of brain tissue.\\n* This shifting can compress vital structures, leading to neurological deficits and potentially coma.\\n\\n**Brain Displacements and Herniations:**\\n\\n* The text describes several types of herniations:\\n    * **Subfalcial herniation:** The cingulate gyrus is pushed under the falx (a membrane separating the brain hemispheres). This often leads to anterior cerebral artery occlusion and frontal lobe infarction.\\n    * **Transtentorial herniation:**  The most common type, where tissue herniates through the tentorium cerebelli (a fold of dura mater).\\n    * **Cerebellar-foramen magnum herniation:** The cerebellar tonsils are pushed downward through the foramen magnum (opening at the base of the skull), compressing the brainstem.\\n\\n**Treatment Strategies for ICP:**\\n\\n* **Hypertonic solutions (mannitol, hypertonic saline):** These pull water out of brain tissue and into the bloodstream, reducing brain swelling and pressure.\\n* **Diuretics (acetazolamide, furosemide):** Reduce CSF production and help create a hyperosmolar state. \\n* **Controlled hyperventilation:** Reduces cerebral blood volume by increasing pH.\\n\\n**Important Considerations:**\\n\\n* These treatments are often temporary measures.\\n* Surgery may be necessary to remove the tumor and relieve pressure on brain tissue.\\n\\n\\nThe passage emphasizes that understanding brain displacements and herniations is crucial for managing patients with brain tumors, as these complications can quickly become life-threatening if not addressed promptly.\"}\n",

In the an-terior portion of the corpus callosum, the lesion tends to be moresevereinthemidlinethaninitslateralparts;inthesplenium,how-ever, the opposite may pertain. The most chronic lesion takes theform ofacentrallyplacedgraycleftorcavity,withcollapseofthesurrounding tissue and reduction in thickness of the corpus cal-losum. Microscopically, corresponding to the gross lesions, oneobservesclearlydemarcatedzonesofdemyelination,withvariableinvolvement of the axis cylinders and an abundance of fatty mac-rophages with gliosis at the margins. Inﬂammatory changes areabsent.\\nInfrequently, lesions of a similar nature are found in the cen-\\ntralportionsoftheanteriorandposteriorcommissuresandthebra-chia pontis. These zones of myelin destruction are always sur-rounded by a rim of intact white matter. The predilection of thisdisease process for commissural ﬁber systems has been stressed,butitiscertainlynotconﬁnedtotheseﬁbers.Symmetricallyplacedlesions have been observed in the columns of Goll, superior cere-bellar peduncles, and cerebralhemispheres,involvingthecentrumsemiovale and extending, in some cases, into the adjacent convo-lutional white matter. As a rule, the internal capsule and coronaradiata, subcortical arcuate ﬁbers, and cerebellum are spared. Inseveralcases,thelesionsofdeﬁciencyamblyopia(seeabove)havebeen added; in others, the lesions of Wernickedisease.\\nManyofthereportedcases,asﬁrstpointedoutbyJequierand\\nWildi,haveinvolvedcorticallesionsofaspecialtype:theneuronsin the third layer of the frontal and temporal lobe cortices haddisappeared and were replaced by a ﬁbrous gliosis. Morel, whoﬁrst described this corticallaminarsclerosis , did not observe its\\nassociationwithMarchiafava-Bignamidisease.However,whenJe-quierandAdamsreviewedhisoriginalcases(unpublished),allhadMarchiafava-Bignamidisease.InasubsequentreportbyDelayandcolleagues comprising 14 cases of cortical laminar sclerosis, thecortical lesion was also consistently associated with a corpus cal-losum lesion. We believe the cortical lesions arebestexplainedassecondary to the callosal degeneration.\\nClinical Features Thediseaseaffectspersonsinmiddleandlate\\nadult life. With few exceptions, the patients have been males and\\nsevere chronic alcoholics. The clinical features of the illness areotherwisequitevariable,andaclear-cutsyndromeofuniformtypehas not emerged. Many patients have presented in a state of ter-minalstupororcoma,precludingadetailedneurologicassessment.In others,theclinicalpicturewasdominatedbythemanifestationsof chronic inebriation and alcohol withdrawal—tremor, seizures,hallucinosis, and delirium tremens. In some of these patients, fol-lowing the subsidence of the withdrawal symptoms, no signs ofneurologic disease could be elicited, even in the end stage of thedisease, which lasted for several days to weeks. In yet anothergroup,aprogressivedementiahasbeendescribed,evolvingslowlyovera3-to6-yearperiodbeforedeath.Emotionaldisordersleadingto acts of violence, marked apathy, moral perversions, and sexualmisdemeanors have been noted in thesepatients;dysarthria,slow-ing and unsteadiness of movement, transient sphincteric inconti-nence, hemiparesis, and apractic or aphasic disorders were super-imposedinothers.Thelaststageofthediseaseischaracterizedbyphysicaldecline,seizures,stupor,andcoma.Animpressivefeatureof these varied neurologic deﬁcits in some patients has been theirtendency toward remission when nutrition was restored.\\nIntwocasesthathavecometoourattention,theclinicalman-\\nifestations were essentially those of bilateral frontal lobe disease:motor and mental slowness, apathy,prominentgraspingandsuck-ingreﬂexes,gegenhalten,incontinence,andaslow,hesitant,wide-based gait. In both of these cases, the neurologic abnormalitiesevolved over a period of about 2 months, and both patientsrecov-ered from these symptoms within a few weeks of hospitalization.Death occurred several years later as a result of liver disease andsubdural hematoma, respectively. In each case, autopsy disclosedan old lesion typical of Marchiafava-Bignami disease conﬁned tothecentralportionofthemostanteriorpartsofthecorpuscallosum,but one had to look closely to see the gray line of gliosis.\\nIn view of the great variability of the clinical picture and the\\nobscuration in many patients of subtle mental and neurologic ab-normalitiesbytheeffectsofchronicinebriationandotheralcoholicneurologic disorders, the diagnosis of Marchiafava-Bignami dis-ease is understandably difﬁcult. In fact, it is rarely made duringlife, but the CT scan and MRI have disclosed some typical butunsuspectedexamples(seeKawamuraetal).Insomecasesstudiedsequentially, MRI disclosed demyelination, swelling,andnecrosisofthecorpuscallosumwithextensiontowardthesubcorticalwhitematter. In rare cases these ﬁndings have reversed over time aftervitamin therapy, leaving residual callosal atrophy (Gambini). Theoccurrence, in a chronic alcoholic, ofafrontal lobesyndromeorasymptom complex that points to a diagnosis of frontal or corpuscallosum tumor but in whom the symptoms remit should suggestthe diagnosis of Marchiafava-Bignamidisease.Theimageappear-ancemaybemistakenformultiplesclerosisorgliomatosiscerebri.\\nPathogenesis and Etiology Originally, Marchiafava-Bignami\\ndisease was attributed to the toxic effects ofalcohol, but thisisan\\nunlikely explanation in view of the prevalence of alcoholism andthe rarity of corpus callosum degeneration.Further,thedistinctivecallosal lesions have not been observed with other neurotoxins.Very rarely,undoubtedexamplesofMarchiafava-Bignamidiseasehave occurred in abstainers, so that alcohol cannot be an indis-pensable factor. A nutritional etiology has been invoked, for thereasons given earlier, but the factor that is deﬁcient has not beendetermined. This view is underscored by reports of improvementinafewbutnotallcasesfollowingadministrationofthiamine.Themechanisms involved in the selective demyelination and nonin-ﬂammatory necrosis of particular areas of white matter remainto be elucidated. Perhaps, when its mechanism becomes known,Marchiafava-Bignami disease, like central pontine myelinolysis(whichitresembleshistologically),willhavetobeconsideredinachapter other than one on nutritional disease.\\nProtein-Calorie Malnutrition (PCM)\\nand Mental Retardation\\nThe reader might gather from the foregoing descriptions that the\\nnervous system is rarely affected by nutritional deﬁciency exceptwhen subjected to the inﬂuence of chronic alcoholism, and thenthe essential problem is oneofdietaryimbalance—aninadequacyof B vitamins in the face of an adequate or near adequate caloricintake.ItistruethattheCNSresiststheeffectsofstarvationbetterthan other organs.

In theT1-weighted image, the CSF appears dark and the cortical borderand cortical–white matter junction are well deﬁned, as in CT im-ages, whereas T2-weighted images show the CSF as white. T2-weighted images highlight alterations in white matter such as in-farction, demyelination, and edema (Table 2-3).\\nSo-called FLAIR (ﬂuid-attenuated inversion recovery) imag-\\ning is a technique that gives a high signal for parenchymal lesionsand a low signal for CSF. It is sensitive to calcium and iron withinbrain tissue, shows early stages of infarction, and accentuates in-ﬂammatory demyelinating lesions. The images generated by thelatest MRI machines are truly remarkable (Fig. 2-2 AtoC). Because\\nof the high degree of contrast between white and gray matter, onecan identify all discrete nuclear structures and lesions within them.Deep lesions in the temporal lobe and structures in the posteriorfossa and at the cervicomedullary junction are seen much betterthan with CT;the structures can be displayed in three planes andare unmarred by signals from adjacent skeletal structures (bonyartifact). Demyelinative lesions stand out with greater clarity andinfarcts can be seen at an earlier stage than with CT. Each of theproducts of disintegrated RBC—methemoglobin, hemosiderin,and ferritin—can be recognized, enabling one to date the age ofhemorrhages and to follow their resolution. Similarly, CSF, fat,calcium, and iron have their own signal characteristics in differentimaging sequences.\\nMRI imaging of the spine provides clear images of the ver-\\ntebral bodies, intervertebral discs, spinal cord, and cauda equina(Fig. 2-2DtoF) and of syringomyelia and other lesions (herniated\\ndiscs, tumors, epidural or subdural hemorrhages, areas of demye-lination, and abscesses). It has practically replaced contrast mye-lography except in certain circumstances where very high resolu-tion images of nerve roots and spinal cord are required.\\nThe administration of gadolinium, a so-called paramagnetic\\nagent that enhances the process of proton relaxation during theT1 sequence of MRI, permits even sharper deﬁnition and high-lights regions surrounding many types of lesions where the blood-brain barrier has been disrupted in the brain, spinal cord, or nerveroots.\\nThe degree of cooperation that is required to perform MRIlimits its use in young children and in the mentally confused orretarded. Some form of sedation is required and most hospitals haveservices which are able to accomplish this with safety. Studying apatient who requires a ventilator is difﬁcult but manageable byusing either hand ventilation or nonferromagnetic ventilators (Bar-nett et al).\\nThe main dangers in the use of MRI are torque or dislodge-\\nment of metal clips on blood vessels, of dental devices and otherferromagnetic objects, and of small metal fragments in the orbit,often acquired unnoticed by operators of machine tools. For thisreason it is wise, in appropriate patients, to obtain plain radiographsof the skull so as to detect metal in these regions. Corneal metalfragments can be removed by an ophthalmic surgeon if an MRIis considered to be obligatory. The presence of a cardiac pace-maker, deﬁbrillator, or implanted stimulator in the brain or spinalcord is an absolute contraindication to the use of MRI, since themagnetic ﬁeld induces unwanted currents in the device and thewires exiting from it. However, most of the newer, weakly ferro-magnetic prosthetic heart valves, intravascular access ports, andaneurysm clips do not represent an untoward risk for magneticimaging. The same is true for joint prostheses. An extensive listof devices that have been tested for their ferromagnetic suscepti-bility and their safety in the MRI machine can be found in themonograph by Shellock, which is updated regularly. There havebeen instances over the years in which physicians have rushed intothe MRI room to assist an acutely ill patient, only to have metalinstruments drawn from their pockets and forcibly strike the patientor magnet.\\nBecause of the development of cataracts in the fetuses of an-\\nimals exposed to MRI, there has been hesitation in performing MRIin pregnant patients, especially in the ﬁrst trimester. However, cur-rent data indicate that it may be performed in such patients providedthat the study is medically indicated. In a study of 1000 pregnantMRI technicians who entered the magnetic ﬁeld frequently (themagnet remains on between procedures), no adverse effects on thefetus could be discerned (Kanal et al). MRI entails some risk inthese situations unless there is direct knowledge of the type ofmaterial that had been used.\\nMany types of MRI artifacts are known, most having to do\\nwith malfunction of the electronics of the magnetic ﬁeld or of themechanics involved in the imaging procedure (for details, see themonograph of Huk et al). Among the most common and problem-atic are CSF ﬂow artifacts in the thoracic spinal cord, giving theimpression of an intradural mass;distortions of the appearance ofstructures at the base of the brain from ferromagnetic dental appli-ances;and lines across the entire image induced by blood ﬂow andpatient movement.\\nThe MRI device is costly and requires special housing and\\ncooling to contain its powerful magnetic ﬁeld. Nevertheless, aswith CT earlier, MRI machines have proliferated and the techniquehas become indispensable for neurologic diagnosis. In most clinicalcircumstances, as noted above, it is advantageous to proceed di-rectly to MRI after the clinical analysis.\\nThe technology of MRI is constantly evolving. The visualiza-\\ntion of blood vessels in the brain (MR angiography;see further on)as well as tumors, compressive lesions, traumatic discontinuitiesof peripheral nerves (Filler et al), and developmental defects of theCNS are among the more reﬁned and promising applications ofMRI. Particular attention should be drawn to diffusion-weightedimaging (DWI), a newer imaging procedure that takes only a min-ute to accomplish and has been invaluable in detecting the earliest', 'result': \"This text provides a comprehensive overview of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology, particularly its applications in neurology. \\n\\nHere's a breakdown of the key points:\\n\\n**Advantages of MRI:**\\n\\n* **Superior Soft Tissue Resolution:** MRI excels at visualizing soft tissues like brain, spinal cord, and nerves due to its use of magnetic fields and radio waves.\\n* **Detailed Anatomical Information:** It provides highly detailed images of anatomical structures, allowing for precise diagnosis of various neurological conditions.\\n* **Non-invasive:** Unlike procedures like CT scans that involve ionizing radiation, MRI is a non-invasive technique, making it safer for repeated use.\\n\\n**Applications in Neurology:**\\n\\n* **Brain Imaging:** Detecting tumors, strokes, multiple sclerosis lesions, brain injuries, and other abnormalities.\\n* **Spinal Cord Imaging:** Diagnosing spinal cord compression, herniated discs, infections, and degenerative diseases.\\n* **Nerve Root Imaging:** Assessing nerve root impingement and injuries.\\n\\n**MRI Techniques:**\\n\\n* **Gadolinium Enhancement:** Using a contrast agent to highlight areas with disrupted blood-brain barrier, aiding in lesion detection.\\n* **Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI):** A fast technique used to detect early signs of stroke by visualizing water movement in brain tissue.\\n* **MR Angiography:** Visualizing blood vessels in the brain and neck to diagnose aneurysms, vascular malformations, and other circulatory problems.\\n\\n**Considerations and Limitations:**\\n\\n* **Cost:** MRI is generally more expensive than CT scans.\\n* **Claustrophobia:** Some patients may experience anxiety due to being enclosed in a narrow space.\\n* **Metal Implants:** Patients with certain metal implants (e.g., pacemakers, aneurysm clips) may not be suitable for MRI.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nMRI has revolutionized neurological diagnosis by providing detailed and non-invasive imaging of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves.

Except for the mass effect theycause, they maybedifﬁculttoseeonMRIscansperformedwithoutgadolinium. The amount of edema surrounding the tumor is highlyvariable. The CSF protein is usually elevated.Treatment Surgical excision should afford permanent cure in all\\nsymptomatic and accessible surface tumors. Recurrence is likely ifremoval is incomplete, as is often the case, but forsomethegrowthrate is so slow that there may be a latency of many years. A fewshow malignant qualities—i.e., a high mitotic index, nuclearatypia, marked nuclear and cellular pleomorphism, and invasive-nessofbrain.Theirregrowthisthenrapidiftheyarenotcompletelyexcised. Tumors that lie beneath the hypothalamus, along the me-dial part of the sphenoid bone and parasellar region, or anterior tothe brainstem are the most difﬁcult to remove surgically. By in-vading adjacent bone, they may become impossible to remove to-tally. Carefully planned radiation therapy including gamma-knifeor proton beam treatment is beneﬁcial in cases that are inoperableand when the tumor is incompletely removed or shows malignantcharacteristics (Kornblith et al). Smaller tumors at the base of theskull can be obliterated or greatly reduced in size by focused ra-diation, probably with less risk than surgery would pose (Changand Alder). Conventional chemotherapy is probably ineffective;hormonal therapy with the antiprogestin agents has been used withvariable results but is still under study (McCutcheon). More re-cently it has been suggested that hydroxyurea has the capacity toshrink unresectable and recurrent meningiomas (Schrell et al); thismode of treatment is still being evaluated.\\nPrimaryCerebralLymphoma As mentioned earlier,thistumor\\nhasassumedincreasingsigniﬁcanceinthelasttwodecadesbecause\\nofitsfrequencyinAIDSandotherimmunosuppressedstates.How-ever, it is also occurring with increased frequency in immunocom-petent persons—a ﬁnding without evident explanation (althoughtheories abound). There is a preponderance of men, with the peakincidence in the ﬁfth through seventh decades, or in the third andfourth decades in patients with AIDS.\\nFor many years, the cell of origin of this tumor was thought\\nto be the reticulum cell and the tumor was regarded as a reticulumcell sarcoma. The meningeal histiocyte and microgliacytes are theequivalent cells in the brain to the reticulum cell of the germinalcenters of lymph nodes. Later, the intracerebral lymphocytes andlymphoblasts, also prominent components of the tumor, led to itsreclassiﬁcation as a lymphoma (large-cell histiocytic type). It isappreciated, on the basis of immunocytochemical studies, that thetumor cells are B lymphocytes. There is a ﬁne reticulum reactionbetween the reticulum cells derived from ﬁbroblasts and microgliaor histiocytes. As matters now stand, most pathologistsbelievethatthe B lymphocyte or lymphoblast is the tumor cell, whereas theﬁne reticulum and “microgliacytes” are secondary interstitial re-actions. Wetend to believethatbothcelltypesarepresentandhavenot entirely abandoned the notion of an origin in a reticulum cell.\\nIn contrast, T-cell lymphomas of the nervous system are rare\\nbut do occur in both immunocompetent patients and in immuno-suppressed patients with AIDS. Since the brain is devoid of lym-phatic tissue, it is uncertain how this tumor arises; onetheoryholdsthat it represents a systemic lymphoma with a particular proclivityto metastasize to the nervous system. This seems unlikely to theauthors; systemic lymphomas of the usual kind rarely metastasize,as discussedfurtheron,under“InvolvementoftheNervousSystemin Systemic Lymphoma.”\\nThese tumors may arise in any part of the cerebrum, cerebel-\\nlum, or brainstem, with 60 percent being in the cerebral hemi-spheres; they may be solitary or multifocal. A periventricular lo-calization is common. Vitreous, uveal, and retinal (ocular)involvement occurs in 10 to 20 percent of cases; here vitreousbiopsymaybediagnostic,butitisnotoftenperformed.(Two-thirdsof patients with ocular lymphoma will have cerebral involvementwithin a year.) The pia-arachnoid may be inﬁltrated, and a purelymeningeal form of B-cell lymphoma that involves peripheral andcranial nerves is also known. Most such cases of what has beentermedneurolymphomatosis present with painful, predominantly\\nmotor polyradiculopathies. One such patient ofours presentedwitha ﬂaccid paraparesis and back and sciatic pain; MRI showed tumorinﬁltrating the cauda equina nerve roots and contiguous meninges.Lai and colleagues have presented evidence that,inadvancedcasesthat were autopsied, microscopic deposits of tumor were found inmany regions of the brain and not solely in areas indicated bynodular enhancement on MRI. Whetherthis indicatesawidespreador multifocal origin of brain lymphoma is not clear.\\nThe primary large-cell lymphoma forms a pinkish gray, soft,\\nill-deﬁned, inﬁltrative mass in the brain, difﬁcult at times to distin-guish from a malignant glioma. Perivascular and meningealspreadresults in shedding of cells into the CSF, accounting perhaps forthe multifocal appearance of the tumor in almost half of the cases.The tumor is highly cellular and grows around and into blood ves-\\n555 CHAPTER 31 INTRACRANIALNEOPLASMSAND PARANEOPLASTICDISORDERS45077 Ropper:AdamsandVictor’sPrinciplesofNeurology,8/EMcGraw-Hill BATCH RIGHT\\ntopofrh\\nbaseofrh\\ncapheight\\nbaseoftext\\nshort\\nstand\\nlong\\ndropfolio\\nFigure 31-3. Astrocytoma of the left frontal lobe; the T2-weighted MRI\\nshows an inﬁltrating tumor with minimal mass effectand slightedema.The\\ndegree of enhancement varies.5 months on average (see below). The addition of the chemother-\\napeutic agent carmustine(BCNU)aloneincreasessurvivalslightly.Although there are no satifsactory randomized trials, it is consid-ered by most neuro-oncologists that somewhat longer survival canbe achieved when a combination of drugs—procarbazine, lomus-tine (CCNU), and vincristine (a combination termed PCV)—is\\ngiven (Levin et al). Cisplatin and carboplatin provide similar mar-ginal improvement in survival beyond that obtained by debulkingand radiation therapy. In keeping with general experience in thisﬁeld, the report of the Glioma Meta-analysis Trialists (GMT)Group concluded there was a clear but small beneﬁt of chemo-therapy. Brachytherapy (implantation of iodine-125 oriridium-193beads or needles) and high-dose focused radiation (stereotactic ra-diosurgery) have so far not signiﬁcantly altered survival times.\\nThe treatment of recurrent tumor after surgery and radiation,\\nan almost inevitable occurrence, is controversial and must beguided by the location and pattern of tumor growth, the patient’sage, and relative state of health. Almost all glioblastomas recurwithin 2 cm of their original site and 10 percent developadditionallesions at distant locations. Reoperation is sometimes undertakenfor local recurrences, as is brachytherapy, both with uncertain re-sults. The most aggressive approach, a second surgery and chemo-therapy, has been generally utilized in patients under age 40 whoseoriginal operation was many months earlier. If the PCV regimendiscussed above has not already been used, that combination orthenewer and better-tolerated alkylating agent temozolomide (whichmay be used if the PCV regimen was administered previously) aresometimes used in cases of recurrent glioblastoma and anaplasticastrocytoma. In general, these chemotherapeutic drugs prolong thesymptom-free interval but have little effect on survival.\\nWith aggressive surgical removal and radiotherapy, as de-\\nscribed above, median survival for patients with glioblastomais 12months, compared to 7 to 9 months without such treatment. Themedian survival in cases of anaplastic astrocytoma is considerablylonger, 2 to 4 years. Viewed from another perspective, in a recentlarge series, the 18-month postoperative survival was 15 percentinpatients with glioblastoma and 62 percent in those with anaplasticastrocytoma.\\nAstrocytoma (Well-Differentiated Astrocytoma) The well-\\ndifferentiated astrocytomas (grades I and II in former classiﬁca-\\ntions), which constitute between 25 and 30 percent of cerebralgliomas, may occur anywhere in the brain or spinal cord. Favoredsites are the cerebrum, cerebellum, hypothalamus, optic nerve andchiasm, and pons. In general, the location of the tumor appears tobeinﬂuencedbytheageofthepatient.Astrocytomasofthecerebralhemispheres arise mainly in adults in their third and fourthdecadesor earlier; astrocytomas in other parts of the nervous system, par-ticularly the posterior fossa and optic nerves, are more frequent inchildren and adolescents. These tumors are classiﬁed further ac-cording to their histologic characteristics: protoplasmic or ﬁbril-lary; gemistocytic (enlarged cells distended with hyaline and eo-sinophilic material); pilocytic (elongated, bipolar cells); andmixedastrocytoma-oligodendroglioma types. The most common type iscomposed of well-differentiated ﬁbrillary astrocytes. The tumorcellscontainglialﬁbrillaryacidicprotein(GFAP),whichisausefuldiagnostic marker in biopsy specimens. Some cerebral astrocyto-mas, as already noted, present as mixed astrocytomas and glio-blastomas.Themostcommonlow-gradeﬁbrillarytypecorrespondstoaWHOgradeIIandisdistinguishedfromthemorebenignWHOgrade I pilocytic tumor (see page 578). The rarer pleomorphicxanthoastrocytoma was also classed as WHO II. Thesedistinctionscorrelate to a large degree with the biologic behavior of the astro-cytomas and therefore have prognostic importance.\\nCerebral astrocytoma is a slowly growing tumor of inﬁltrative\\ncharacter with a tendency in some cases to form large cavities orpseudocysts. Other tumors of this category are noncavitating andappear grayish white, ﬁrm, and relatively avascular, almost indis-tinguishable from normal white matter, with which they mergeim-perceptibly. Fine granules of calcium may be deposited in parts ofthe tumor, but this ﬁnding in a slow-growing intracerebral tumoris more characteristic of an oligodendroglioma.

Cyst formation and small amounts of calcium arecommon, especially in cerebellar tumors. The ﬁbrillary tumorshave a less stereotyped appearance, generally taking the form of ahypodense mass with less well deﬁned borders and little or nocontrast enhancement (Fig. 31-3).', 'result': \"This text provides a detailed explanation of astrocytomas, a type of brain tumor.

Extraneural metastases (cervical lymph nodes, lung, liver,\\nbone) may occur, but usually only after craniotomy, which allowstumor cells to reach scalp lymphatics. In rare instances the tumorcells may be spontaneously blood-borne and become metastatic tolung or liver. Decerebrate attacks (“cerebellar ﬁts”) appear in thelate stages of the disease.\\nThe radiologic appearance is also distinctive: high signal in-\\ntensity on both T1- and T2-weighted MRIs, heterogeneous en-hancement but of lesser extent than is typical for gliomas, and,of course, the typical location adjacent to and extending into thefourth ventricle. The tumor frequently ﬁlls the fourth ventricleand inﬁltrates its ﬂoor (Fig. 31-11). Seeding of the tumor mayoccur on the ependymal and meningeal surfaces of the cisternamagna and around the spinal cord. The tumor is solid, gray-pinkincolor,andfairlywelldemarcatedfromtheadjacentbraintissue.It is very cellular, and the cells are small and closely packedwithhyperchromatic nuclei, little cytoplasm, many mitoses, and a ten-dency to form clusters and pseudorosettes. The interstitial tissueis sparse.Treatment Treatment begins with maximal resection of the tu-\\nmor. The addition of chemotherapy and radiotherapy of the entireneuraxis improves the rate and length of disease-free survivalevenfor those children with the most extensive tumors at the time ofdiagnosis (Packer). The combination of surgery, radiation of theentire neuraxis, and chemotherapy permits a 5-year survival inmore than 80 percent of cases. The presence of desmoplastic fea-tures (i.e., connective tissue formations) is associated with a betterprognosis. Brainstem invasion, spinal subarachnoid metastases,in-complete removal, and very early age of onset (younger than 3years) reduce the period of survival.Neuroblastoma This, the most common solid tumor of child-\\nhood, is a slightly different tumor from medulloblastoma but ofnearly identical histologic appearance, arising in the adrenal me-dulla and sometimes metastasizing widely. Usually it remains ex-tradural if it invades the cranial and spinal cavities. Polymyoclonus\\nwith opsoclonus may occur as a paraneoplastic complication, as\\ndiscussed further on. A rare form of neuroblastic medulloblastomain adults tends to be more benign (Rubinstein).Retinoblastoma Another closely related tumor is the retinoblas-\\ntoma. This proves to be one of the most frequent extracranial ma-\\nlignant tumors of infancy and childhood. Eighty percent developbefore the ﬁfth year of life. It is asmall-celltumorwithneuroﬁbrilsand, like the neuroblastoma, has a tendency to formrosettes,whichare diagnostic histologic features. The tumor develops within theeyeandtheblindnessthatitinducesmaybeoverlookedinaninfantor small child. The tumor is easily seen ophthalmoscopically,sinceit arises from cells of the developing retina. An abnormal proteinencoded by a growth-suppressor or antioncogenic gene,mentionedearlier in relation to the genetics of brain tumors, has been identi-ﬁed. It is postulated that an inherited mutation affects one allele ofthe normal gene, and only if this is accompanied by amutationthateliminates the function of the second allele will the tumor develop.Early recognition and radiation or surgery effect cure.\\nEpendymoma and Papilloma of the Fourth Ventricle Epen-\\ndymomas ,aspointedoutearlierinthischapter,arisefromthelining\\ncells in the walls of the ventricles. About 70 percent of them orig-\\ninate in the fourth ventricle, according to Fokes and Earle(Fig.31-12). Postmortem, some of these tumors, if small, are found pro-truding into the fourth ventricle, never having produced localsymptoms. Whereas the supratentorial ependymoma occurs at allages, fourth ventricular ependymomas appear mostly in childhood.In the large series of Fokes and Earle (83 cases), 33 developed inthe ﬁrst decade, 6 in the second, and 44 after the age of 20 years.Males have been affected almost twice as often as females.\\nEpendymomas usually arise from the ﬂoor of the fourth ven-\\ntricle and extend through the foramina of Luschka and Magendie.Theymaylaterinvadethemedulla.Thesetumorsproduceaclinicalsyndrome much like that of the medulloblastoma except for theirmore protracted course and lack of early cerebellar signs. The his-tologic features of this tumor have been described earlier in thischapter. The degree of anaplastic change varies and has prognosticsigniﬁcance. The most anaplastic form is the ependymoblastoma ,\\na highly aggressive tumor that falls within the spectrum of primi-tive neuroectodermal tumors (see below).\\nSymptoms may be present for 1 or 2 years before diagnosis\\nand operation.

Pathologically, intension hydrocephalus, the edema extends for only 2 to 3 mm fromthe ventricular wall. However, MRI suggests that the periventric-ular edema is more extensive than what is observedpathologically.Also, there are experimental data to show that a transependymalorperiventricular route is utilized for absorption of CSF in hydro-cephalus (Rosenberg et al). We would refer to this state as peri-ventricular interstitial edema in association with tension hydro-cephalus.\\nTreatmentofBrainEdemaandRaisedICP (See also page 766)\\nThe deﬁnitive treatment of any given case (excision of a tumor,\\ntreatment of intracranial infection, placement of a shunt, etc.) will,of course, begoverned by theunderlyingdisease.Hereweconsideronly the therapeutic measures that can be directed against theedema itself and the raised ICP that it causes in cases of braintumor.\\nThe use of high-potency glucocorticosteroids has a beneﬁcial\\neffectonthevasogenicedemaassociatedwithtumors,bothprimaryand metastatic, sometimes beginning within hours. Probably thesesteroids act directly on the endothelial cells, reducing their per-meability. Steroids also shrink normal brain tissue, thus reducingoverall intracranial pressure. In addition, drugs such as dexameth-asone reduce the vasogenic edema associated with brain abscessand head injury, but their usefulness in cases of large cerebral in-farctions, contusions, and hemorrhage is less clear. Possibly theswellingofnecrotictissueisreduced;however,thereisnoevidencethat cytotoxic or cellular edema responds to administration of glu-cocorticoids.\\nFor patients with brain tumor, it is common practice to use\\ndoses of dexamethasone of approximately 4 mg every 6 h, or theequivalent dose of methyprednisolone (Solu-Medrol), while a fewpatients require a rigid schedule; otherwise, a dose with meals andat bedtime usually sufﬁces to suppress headache and focal tumorsigns. In patients with large tumors and marked secondary edema,further beneﬁt is sometimes achieved by the administration of ex-tremely high doses of dexamethasone, to a total of 100 mg per dayor more. An initial dose may be given intravenously. Always to bekept in mind are the potentially serious side effects of sustainedsteroid administration, even at standard dose levels. Therefore theschedule should be carefully titrated to the desired clinical effect.It is also recognized that these drugs interfere with the metabolismof certain anticonvulsants commonly used in brain tumor patients.\\nInpatientswhohavebrainedemaandwhorequireintravenous\\nﬂuids, solutions containing water (“free water”) not matched byequivalent amounts of sodium should be avoided. Normal saline(314 mosmol/L) is preferable and lactated Ringer’s solution (os-molarity 289 mosmol/L) is acceptable, but dextrose solutionsalone, in any concentration (except D\\n5/NS), are to be avoided be-\\ncause of their hypo-osmolar nature.\\nThe parenteral administration of hypertonic solutions, to\\nwhich the brain is only partially permeable (mannitol, hypertonicsaline, urea, glycerol), by shifting water from brain to plasma, isan effective means of reducing brain volume and lowering ICP.Edema, however, is actually little affected by these agents. Man-nitol is the most widely used; a 25% solution is administered par-enterally in a dose of 0.5 to 1.0 g/kg body weight over a period of2 to 10 min. Hypertonic saline solutions (3 or 1.5%) are equallyeffective. Urea is used less often and glycerol is not much favoredin the United States because of its high caloric content, but it isused in Europe, largely because it can be taken orally on an out-patient basis. A single administration of these solutes has only ashort-lived effect, a matter of several hours or less as the brainextracellular space reaches an equilibrium concentration, but re-peateduseonaregularschedulecanleadtoareductioninheadacheand stabilization of some of the deleterious effects of a mass. Cer-tain diuretic drugs, notably acetazolamide and furosemide, aresaidto be helpful in special instances (interstitial edema, pseudotumorcerebri) by virtue of creating a hyperosmolar state and by reducingthe formation of CSF. However, their effects are usually transient.\\nAside from a diuresis, which may raise serum osmolality,\\nhighly permeable solutes such as glucose do little to reduce brainvolume, since they do not create an osmolar gradient that moveswater from the brain to the vasculature. Furthermore,withrepeatedadministration of hyperosmolar solutions such as mannitol or withdiuretics, the brain gradually increases its osmolality—the resultof added intracellular solute; these agents are thereforenot suitablefor long-term use. The notion that hyperosmolar agents might ex-aggerate tissue shifts by shrinking normal brain tissue has not beensubstantiated. The net effect of hyperosmolar therapy is reﬂectedroughly by the degree of hyperosmolarity and hypernatremia thatis attained.\\nControlled hyperventilation is another method of rapidly re-\\nducing brain volume by producing respiratory alkalosis and cere-bral vasoconstriction; it is used mainly in brain trauma with highICP (see Chap. 55), during intracranial surgery, and in the man-agement of patients who have become acutely comatose from themass effect of a tumor, but its effect is brief.\\nBrainDisplacementsandHerniations (See also Chap. 17) The\\nproblem of brain displacements and herniations is of vital impor-\\ntance in all mass lesions, and the underlying principles are partic-ularly relevant to enlarging brain tumors. The main aspects of thisproblem, particularly the coma-producing mechanisms, have beenconsidered on page 310. The pressure from a mass within any onedural compartment causes shifts or herniations of brain tissue to anadjacent compartment where the pressure is lower. The three well-known herniations are: subfalcial ,transtentorial , andcerebellar–\\nforamenmagnum (seeFig. 17-1), andthereareseverallessfamiliar\\nones (upwardcerebellar-tentorial ,diencephalic–sellaturcica ,and\\norbitalfrontal–middlecranial fossa). Herniation of swollen brain\\nthrough an opening in the calvarium, in relation to craniocerebralinjury or operation, is yet another (transcalvarial) type. As men-tioned, the transtentorial herniations relating primarily to comawere discussed in Chap. 17. Here, those that are often seen incasesof brain tumor are emphasized. The writings of Meyer, Jefferson,and Kernohan may be consulted for the early descriptions of theherniations.\\nSubfalcialherniation , in which the cingulate gyrus is pushed\\nunder the falx, occurs frequently, but little is known of its clinicalmanifestations except that there is often occlusion of an anteriorcerebral artery and frontallobeinfarction.The cerebellar–foramen\\nmagnum herniation orpressure cone , described by Cushing in\\n1917, consists of downward displacement of the inferior medialparts of the cerebellar hemispheres (mainly the ventralparaﬂocculior tonsillae) through the foramen magnum, behind the cervicalcord. The displacement may be bilateral or, in the case of a one-sided cerebellar lesion, ipsilateral. Bilateral displacement may re-', 'result': 'The provided text describes various aspects of brain tumors and their effects on surrounding structures.

Except for the mass effect theycause, they maybedifﬁculttoseeonMRIscansperformedwithoutgadolinium. The amount of edema surrounding the tumor is highlyvariable. The CSF protein is usually elevated.Treatment Surgical excision should afford permanent cure in all\\nsymptomatic and accessible surface tumors. Recurrence is likely ifremoval is incomplete, as is often the case, but forsomethegrowthrate is so slow that there may be a latency of many years. A fewshow malignant qualities—i.e., a high mitotic index, nuclearatypia, marked nuclear and cellular pleomorphism, and invasive-nessofbrain.Theirregrowthisthenrapidiftheyarenotcompletelyexcised. Tumors that lie beneath the hypothalamus, along the me-dial part of the sphenoid bone and parasellar region, or anterior tothe brainstem are the most difﬁcult to remove surgically. By in-vading adjacent bone, they may become impossible to remove to-tally. Carefully planned radiation therapy including gamma-knifeor proton beam treatment is beneﬁcial in cases that are inoperableand when the tumor is incompletely removed or shows malignantcharacteristics (Kornblith et al). Smaller tumors at the base of theskull can be obliterated or greatly reduced in size by focused ra-diation, probably with less risk than surgery would pose (Changand Alder). Conventional chemotherapy is probably ineffective;hormonal therapy with the antiprogestin agents has been used withvariable results but is still under study (McCutcheon). More re-cently it has been suggested that hydroxyurea has the capacity toshrink unresectable and recurrent meningiomas (Schrell et al); thismode of treatment is still being evaluated.\\nPrimaryCerebralLymphoma As mentioned earlier,thistumor\\nhasassumedincreasingsigniﬁcanceinthelasttwodecadesbecause\\nofitsfrequencyinAIDSandotherimmunosuppressedstates.How-ever, it is also occurring with increased frequency in immunocom-petent persons—a ﬁnding without evident explanation (althoughtheories abound). There is a preponderance of men, with the peakincidence in the ﬁfth through seventh decades, or in the third andfourth decades in patients with AIDS.\\nFor many years, the cell of origin of this tumor was thought\\nto be the reticulum cell and the tumor was regarded as a reticulumcell sarcoma. The meningeal histiocyte and microgliacytes are theequivalent cells in the brain to the reticulum cell of the germinalcenters of lymph nodes. Later, the intracerebral lymphocytes andlymphoblasts, also prominent components of the tumor, led to itsreclassiﬁcation as a lymphoma (large-cell histiocytic type). It isappreciated, on the basis of immunocytochemical studies, that thetumor cells are B lymphocytes. There is a ﬁne reticulum reactionbetween the reticulum cells derived from ﬁbroblasts and microgliaor histiocytes. As matters now stand, most pathologistsbelievethatthe B lymphocyte or lymphoblast is the tumor cell, whereas theﬁne reticulum and “microgliacytes” are secondary interstitial re-actions. Wetend to believethatbothcelltypesarepresentandhavenot entirely abandoned the notion of an origin in a reticulum cell.\\nIn contrast, T-cell lymphomas of the nervous system are rare\\nbut do occur in both immunocompetent patients and in immuno-suppressed patients with AIDS. Since the brain is devoid of lym-phatic tissue, it is uncertain how this tumor arises; onetheoryholdsthat it represents a systemic lymphoma with a particular proclivityto metastasize to the nervous system. This seems unlikely to theauthors; systemic lymphomas of the usual kind rarely metastasize,as discussedfurtheron,under“InvolvementoftheNervousSystemin Systemic Lymphoma.”\\nThese tumors may arise in any part of the cerebrum, cerebel-\\nlum, or brainstem, with 60 percent being in the cerebral hemi-spheres; they may be solitary or multifocal. A periventricular lo-calization is common. Vitreous, uveal, and retinal (ocular)involvement occurs in 10 to 20 percent of cases; here vitreousbiopsymaybediagnostic,butitisnotoftenperformed.(Two-thirdsof patients with ocular lymphoma will have cerebral involvementwithin a year.) The pia-arachnoid may be inﬁltrated, and a purelymeningeal form of B-cell lymphoma that involves peripheral andcranial nerves is also known. Most such cases of what has beentermedneurolymphomatosis present with painful, predominantly\\nmotor polyradiculopathies. One such patient ofours presentedwitha ﬂaccid paraparesis and back and sciatic pain; MRI showed tumorinﬁltrating the cauda equina nerve roots and contiguous meninges.Lai and colleagues have presented evidence that,inadvancedcasesthat were autopsied, microscopic deposits of tumor were found inmany regions of the brain and not solely in areas indicated bynodular enhancement on MRI. Whetherthis indicatesawidespreador multifocal origin of brain lymphoma is not clear.\\nThe primary large-cell lymphoma forms a pinkish gray, soft,\\nill-deﬁned, inﬁltrative mass in the brain, difﬁcult at times to distin-guish from a malignant glioma. Perivascular and meningealspreadresults in shedding of cells into the CSF, accounting perhaps forthe multifocal appearance of the tumor in almost half of the cases.The tumor is highly cellular and grows around and into blood ves-', 'result': \"This text excerpt describes different types of brain tumors, specifically **meningiomas** and **primary cerebral lymphoma**. \\n\\nHere's a breakdown of the key points:\\n\\n**Meningiomas:**\\n\\n*  Originate from the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord.\\n* Often slow-growing and benign (non-cancerous).\\n* Can cause symptoms depending on their location and size.\\n* Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, and hormonal therapy.\\n\\n**Primary Cerebral Lymphoma:**\\n\\n*  A type of cancer that originates in the brain from B lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).\\n* More common in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with AIDS.\\n* Presents as a pinkish gray, soft mass within the brain.\\n* Can spread through the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\\n* Treatment options include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery.\\n\\n**The text also highlights:**\\n\\n*  The increasing prevalence of primary cerebral lymphoma in recent decades.\\n* The challenges in diagnosing and treating these tumors due to their complex nature and location within the brain.\\n\\n\\nLet me know if you have any further questions about this text or brain tumors in general!\"}\n",

This might be particularly relevant if there are specific tumor antigens that can be targeted. \\n3. **Clinical Trials:** Consider enrolling in a clinical trial investigating novel treatments for brain tumors, as this could offer access to cutting-edge therapies not yet widely available.\\n4. **Symptom Management:** Focus on improving the patient's quality of life by managing symptoms such as pain, headaches, and neurological deficits with medications and supportive care.\\n\\n**Important Considerations:**\\n\\n* **Detailed Evaluation:** A thorough evaluation is crucial to determine the precise type and subtype of tumor (e.g., glioblastoma, meningioma), which will guide treatment decisions.\\n* **Multidisciplinary Team:**  A team of specialists including neuro-oncologists, radiation oncologists, neurosurgeons, and palliative care providers should collaborate to develop a personalized treatment plan. \\n\\n\\nThis information is for educational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

Here's why:\\n\\n* **Enhancing tumor:** This means the tumor is taking up contrast dye (gadolinium) during an MRI scan. Enhancing tumors are typically highly vascularized (have lots of blood vessels), a characteristic often seen in active and growing tumors.\\n* **Gadolinium enhancement:**  This specifically indicates that the tumor has leaky blood vessels, allowing the contrast dye to leak out into the surrounding tissue. This leakage is often associated with an active and aggressive tumor.\\n* **Active tumor:** This implies that the tumor is growing and multiplying.\\n\\n* **Breach of blood-brain barrier:** The blood-brain barrier is a protective shield that regulates what enters the brain. A breach in this barrier suggests inflammation, damage, and potentially the spread of cancer cells.\\n\\n**Treatment Plan:** Given the aggressive nature of this tumor, immediate and comprehensive treatment is crucial.  A multidisciplinary approach involving neurosurgeons, oncologists, and radiation therapists is essential. Here's a potential treatment plan:\\n\\n1. **Surgery:** If possible, surgery may be attempted to remove as much of the tumor as safely feasible. However, the location and extent of the tumor will determine the success and risks of surgical intervention.\\n2. **Radiation Therapy:** Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells. It can be used before or after surgery to shrink the tumor and prevent its regrowth.\\n3. **Chemotherapy:** Chemotherapy drugs can target and destroy cancer cells throughout the body. This may be used in conjunction with radiation therapy or surgery, depending on the type of tumor.\\n\\n**Important Notes:**\\n\\n* The specific treatment plan will be tailored to the individual patient based on factors like age, overall health, tumor size, location, and aggressiveness.\\n* Regular follow-up appointments with medical professionals are essential to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and detect any potential recurrence.\\n\\n\\nIt is crucial for the individual to consult with qualified medical professionals for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.\"}\n",

It's particularly useful for detecting brain tumors, blood vessel abnormalities, nerve damage, and developmental defects.  Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a newer, rapid MRI technique valuable in identifying early stroke signs. \\n\\n**Treatment Plan:** While MRI itself doesn't treat conditions, the information it provides guides treatment decisions made by neurologists. \\n\\n**Precautions:**\\n* **Metal implants/devices:**  MRI can be dangerous for individuals with certain metallic implants or devices due to magnetic interference. Pre-screening is crucial.\\n* **Pregnancy:** Though considered safe in most cases, MRI during early pregnancy requires careful consideration and consultation with a physician.\\n\\n\\nLet me know if you have any more questions.\"}\n",

Prognosis depends on tumor grade, location, and patient age.\\n\\n**Precautions:** Regular monitoring for tumor recurrence and potential side effects of treatment is crucial. Patients should report any new neurological symptoms promptly.\\n\\n\\n**Note:** This summary provides general information.

      "Background, gray color, non-tumor areas\n",
      "**Result:**\n",
      "This text describes how MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is used to visualize different parts of the brain and spine. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **MRI Basics:** It uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of the body's internal structures. Unlike CT scans, which use X-rays, MRI doesn't involve radiation.\n",
      "* **Brain Imaging:**  MRI can show areas of gray matter (where nerve cell bodies are located), white matter (made up of nerve fibers), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and blood vessels in the brain. It can also detect abnormalities like tumors, strokes, multiple sclerosis lesions, and developmental defects.\n",
      "* **Spine Imaging:** MRI is particularly useful for visualizing the spinal cord, intervertebral discs, and surrounding structures.  It can diagnose conditions such as herniated discs, spinal stenosis, syringomyelia (a fluid-filled cyst in the spinal cord), and abscesses.\n",
      "* **Gadolinium Contrast:** Sometimes a contrast agent called gadolinium is used to enhance the visibility of certain areas during MRI. This helps highlight areas where the blood-brain barrier is disrupted, such as in inflammation or tumors.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Points:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* MRI is a powerful diagnostic tool for neurologists and other medical professionals.\n",
      "* It provides detailed images without using ionizing radiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know if you have any more questions!\n",
      "\n",
      "### Query (Label 1): \n",
      "Necrotic tumor core (NCR) and non-enhancing tumor core (NET), low cell activity, treatment resistance\n",
      "**Result:**\n",
      "This describes two important characteristics of a tumor that are often associated with treatment resistance:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Necrotic Tumor Core (NCR):** This refers to the central part of the tumor where cells have died due to lack of blood supply or other factors.  NCR is a sign that the tumor is growing rapidly and may not be responding well to treatment.\n",
      "* **Non-enhancing Tumor Core (NET):**  This describes the area within the tumor that doesn't take up contrast dye during imaging scans. This indicates low cell activity, meaning the cells are not actively dividing or growing as quickly. While NET itself isn't necessarily a sign of resistance, it often occurs alongside NCR and can suggest treatment challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Low Cell Activity:** This implies the tumor is not progressing rapidly, but it also means that treatments targeting rapidly dividing cells might be less effective.\n",
      "* **Treatment Resistance:** The combination of these factors—NCR, NET, and low cell activity—strongly suggests that the tumor is resistant to current therapies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially, this tumor profile indicates a challenging case where conventional treatments may not be as effective. Further investigation and potentially more specialized treatment strategies would be needed. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Query (Label 2): \n",
      "Peritumoral edema, tumor invasion, critical for therapy planning and surgical resection\n",
      "**Result:**\n",
      "This passage emphasizes the importance of understanding **peritumoral edema** (swelling around a tumor) and **tumor invasion** for effective treatment of brain tumors.  \n",
      "\n",
      "* **Peritumoral edema:** This swelling can significantly increase pressure on surrounding brain tissue, complicating surgical planning and potentially causing damage. \n",
      "\n",
      "* **Tumor invasion:** If a tumor has spread into nearby structures, it makes surgical removal more complex and risky. \n",
      "\n",
      "Clinicians must carefully assess both factors to develop the safest and most effective treatment plan, which may involve surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Query (Label 4): \n",
      "Enhancing tumor, gadolinium enhancement, active tumor, breach of blood-brain barrier\n",
      "**Result:**\n",
      "This medical information describes a tumor that is actively growing and likely malignant.  Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Enhancing tumor:** The tumor is taking up a contrast dye (gadolinium) during an imaging scan, indicating increased vascularity and active cellular growth – a hallmark of tumors. \n",
      "* **Gadolinium enhancement:** This specifically refers to the contrast dye used in scans like MRIs.  Enhanced areas on these images often signify inflammation or abnormal blood vessel development, both common in tumor growth.\n",
      "* **Active tumor:** This suggests the tumor is not static; it's enlarging and progressing. \n",
      "\n",
      "* **Breach of blood-brain barrier:** The blood-brain barrier normally protects the brain from harmful substances.  A breach allows for increased permeability, often seen in tumors as they invade surrounding tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Taken together, these findings strongly suggest a malignant tumor actively growing and potentially invading nearby brain structures.  \n",
